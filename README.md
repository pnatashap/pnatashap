### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natasha, I am Software Engineer in Test (sometimes it is called SDET). May be you have no idea, what does it mean, because usually nobody undertsands what we are doing or may be you are so unlucky who work with bad programmer supposed that SDET is a good position for him. 

In short words SDET is programmer passioned in Quality: we are creating all types of tests, checking unit-tests from developers, killing faky-tests, creating many kind of pipelines to check project's health and many other actions to prevent bugs. 

I hate 'We need to rewrite everything' approach, so if you have some intersting project and only need to revive it (create CI, write or improve autotests, fix bugs) feel free to reach out to me. Please do not think that it is an easy job, according to my experience any project can be renovated in about 6 months.
